This package contains codes for paper “An Online Algorithm for Separating Sparse and Low-dimensional Signal Sequences from their Sum (Han Guo, Chenlu Qiu and Namrata Vaswani, to appear in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing)”.

“PracReProCS_pPCA.m” and “PracReProCS_recursivePCA” are two versions of the main algorithm (Practical ReProCS) described in the paper. “Expt_SimulatedData.m” and “Expt_PartlySimulatedData.m” implement MonteCarlo experiments using simulated and partly simulated data, respectively. All real video data used for experiment in the paper can be found in the Data folder.

Feel free to contact Han Guo (hanguo@iastate.edu) for any question.
